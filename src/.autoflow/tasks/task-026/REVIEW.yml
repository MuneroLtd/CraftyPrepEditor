    title: E2E tests cannot locate file upload input
    location: tests/e2e/enhanced-sliders.spec.ts

    description: |
      All E2E tests in enhanced-sliders.spec.ts are failing because the test setup
      cannot find the file upload input element. The test attempts to upload an image
      in beforeEach() but gets "TimeoutError: page.setInputFiles: Timeout exceeded"

    error_message: |
      TimeoutError: page.setInputFiles: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
      Call log:
        - waiting for locator('input[type="file"]')

    root_cause: |
      One of the following:
      1. The file upload input is not visible/rendered on page load
      2. The selector 'input[type="file"]' is incorrect or too generic
      3. The application requires user interaction before showing file input
      4. The page hasn't fully loaded when test tries to interact
      5. The file input is hidden/replaced by custom upload component

    impact: |
      - Cannot run E2E tests for enhanced sliders
      - Cannot verify visual appearance, interactions, or accessibility in real browser
      - Acceptance criteria requiring E2E validation cannot be confirmed
      - 19 E2E test cases blocked

    reproduction:
      1. Navigate to https://craftyprep.demosrv.uk
      2. Try to locate input[type="file"] element
      3. Attempt to upload file
      4. Test times out waiting for element

    expected_behavior: |
      File upload input should be:
      - Present in DOM on page load
      - Accessible via 'input[type="file"]' selector
      - Ready to accept file uploads immediately
      - Or: Test should wait for proper application initialization

    root_cause_analysis: |
      **FOUND**: The file input element in FileDropzone.tsx (line 86-94) has `className="hidden"`,
      making it invisible. Playwright's `page.setInputFiles()` requires the element to be visible
      by default, which causes the timeout.

      However, Playwright CAN interact with hidden file inputs using `locator().setInputFiles()`.
      The issue is using the wrong method - `page.setInputFiles()` instead of
      `page.locator('input[type="file"]').setInputFiles()`.

    solution: |
      **CORRECT APPROACH** (Works with hidden inputs):
      ```typescript
      await page.goto(BASE_URL);
      await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');

      // Use locator().setInputFiles() - works with hidden inputs
      await page.locator('input[type="file"]').setInputFiles({
        name: 'test-image.png',
        mimeType: 'image/png',
        buffer: Buffer.from('iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNk+M9QDwADhgGAWjR9awAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==', 'base64'),
      });

      await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="preview-canvas"]', { timeout: 5000 });
      await page.click('button:has-text("Auto Prep")');
      await page.waitForSelector('text=Brightness', { timeout: 5000 });
      ```

    fix_details: |
      The FileDropzone component (components/FileDropzone.tsx):
      - Has hidden file input (line 86-94: `className="hidden"`)
      - Input is triggered by clicking the visible dropzone area (line 42-46)
      - This is a common UX pattern for custom file uploads

      Playwright can handle hidden file inputs, but requires using the Locator API:
      - ❌ WRONG: `page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', ...)`
      - ✅ CORRECT: `page.locator('input[type="file"]').setInputFiles(...)`

        action: Update enhanced-sliders.spec.ts beforeEach()
        changes: |
          1. Change `await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', ...)`
             to `await page.locator('input[type="file"]').setInputFiles(...)`
          2. Add `await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')` after goto()
          3. The hidden input will accept file uploads via Playwright

    title: Missing integration tests for component integration

    description: |
      While unit tests cover individual components well, there are no integration
      tests verifying how EnhancedSlider and SliderInput work together with parent
      components (BrightnessSlider, ContrastSlider, ThresholdSlider).

    impact: |
      - Cannot verify slider integration with actual image processing
      - Cannot verify value changes trigger correct image updates
      - Risk of integration bugs not caught by unit tests

    suggested_fixes:
      - Add integration tests for:
        * BrightnessSlider with EnhancedSlider
        * ContrastSlider with EnhancedSlider
        * ThresholdSlider with EnhancedSlider
        * Verify onChange callbacks propagate correctly
        * Verify image processing triggers with slider changes

    title: E2E test file in root instead of src/tests/e2e/

    description: |
      The enhanced-sliders.spec.ts file is in the correct location (src/tests/e2e/)
      but Playwright may be looking in the wrong directory due to configuration.

    impact: Minimal - tests are found, but organizational clarity could be better

    suggested_fixes:
      - Verify playwright.config.ts points to correct test directory
      - Ensure testDir is set to './tests/e2e' or './src/tests/e2e'

      details: |
        1. Inspect live application at https://craftyprep.demosrv.uk
        2. Identify correct selector for file upload input
        3. Update enhanced-sliders.spec.ts beforeEach() with correct selector
        4. Add proper wait conditions for application ready state
        5. Consider adding data-testid attributes to file upload component

    - priority: HIGH
      action: Re-run E2E tests after fix
      details: "Verify all 19 E2E tests pass after TEST-001 is resolved"

    - priority: MEDIUM
      action: Add integration tests (TEST-002)
      details: "Create integration tests for slider components with parent components"

  if_all_pass:
    - Update task status to COMPLETE
    - Run /verify-implementation for full E2E verification
    - Document test results in task completion notes

recommendations:
  - Add data-testid attributes to key UI elements for reliable E2E testing
  - Consider visual regression testing for slider appearance
  - Add performance benchmarks for animation frame rate
  - Document keyboard shortcuts in user-facing documentation

test_summary:
  total_tests_written: 45 (unit) + 19 (E2E) = 64 tests
  tests_passing: 45 (unit)
  tests_failing: 19 (E2E - all blocked by setup issue)
  tests_skipped: 0
  coverage_estimate: "80%+ (excellent unit coverage, E2E blocked)"

overall_assessment: |
  PARTIAL PASS - Unit tests are excellent (45/45 passing) with comprehensive
  coverage of component functionality, props, keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility.

  E2E tests are completely blocked by application setup issue (TEST-001). Once the
  file upload selector is fixed, E2E tests should be able to run and validate
  visual appearance, interactions, and real-world usage.

  Status: REVIEWFIX (requires E2E test fix before proceeding to COMPLETE)
