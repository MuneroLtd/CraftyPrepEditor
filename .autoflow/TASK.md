### Task 3.3: Settings Persistence (localStorage)

**ID**: task-022
**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: PENDING
**Estimated Effort**: 3 hours

**Description**:
Persist user settings (custom preset, slider values) in browser localStorage for improved user experience across sessions.

**Required Reading**:
- .autoflow/docs/FUNCTIONAL.md#settings-persistence - Storage requirements
- .autoflow/docs/SECURITY.md#data-storage - Privacy considerations

**Design References** (full docs):
- üìò [.autoflow/docs/FUNCTIONAL.md](.autoflow/docs/FUNCTIONAL.md) - Settings persistence requirements

## üîÑ Workflow

**For each task**:
1. **`/plan`** ‚Üí Creates detailed implementation plan in `.autoflow/tasks/task-XXX/`
2. **`/build`** ‚Üí Implements code following TDD (tests first, then implementation)
3. **`/code-review`** ‚Üí Validates DRY, SOLID, FANG principles, security, performance
4. **Loop**: Repeat `/build` ‚Üí `/code-review` until all blockers resolved (status: REVIEWFIX ‚Üí REVIEW)
5. **`/test`** ‚Üí Runs full test suite, verifies ‚â•80% coverage
6. **`/commit`** ‚Üí Commits code and marks task COMPLETE

**Automated workflow** (recommended):
```bash
/auto-flow    # Orchestrates: plan ‚Üí build ‚Üí code-review ‚Üí test ‚Üí commit
```

**Task status progression**:
```
PENDING ‚Üí PLANNED ‚Üí REVIEW ‚Üí TEST ‚Üí COMPLETE
           ‚Üì         ‚Üì        ‚Üì
         REVIEWFIX ‚Üê‚Üí (automatic quality loop)
```
