## 🔄 Workflow

**For each task**:
1. **`/plan`** → Creates detailed implementation plan in `.autoflow/tasks/task-XXX/`
2. **`/build`** → Implements code following TDD (tests first, then implementation)
3. **`/code-review`** → Validates DRY, SOLID, FANG principles, security, performance
4. **Loop**: Repeat `/build` → `/code-review` until all blockers resolved (status: REVIEWFIX → REVIEW)
5. **`/test`** → Runs full test suite, verifies ≥80% coverage
6. **`/commit`** → Commits code and marks task COMPLETE

**Automated workflow** (recommended):
```bash
/auto-flow    # Orchestrates: plan → build → code-review → test → commit
```

**Task status progression**:
```
PENDING → PLANNED → REVIEW → TEST → COMPLETE
           ↓         ↓        ↓
         REVIEWFIX ←→ (automatic quality loop)
```

## 📝 Notes

- **Sprint 1 Complete**: Foundation complete, CI/CD pipeline operational
- **Max 10 tasks** per sprint for focused execution and predictable velocity
- **TDD approach**: Write tests first, then implement features
- **Quality gates**: Automated `/code-review` ensures standards (no skipping)
- **Documentation-driven**: All tasks reference specific design doc sections
- **Task plans**: `/plan` command creates detailed plans in `.autoflow/tasks/task-XXX/`
- **Completed tasks**: Moved to COMPLETED_TASKS.md and removed from TASK.md
- **Sprint auto-load**: When Sprint 2 completes, Sprint 3 tasks auto-populate from SPRINTS.md
