## 🔄 Workflow

**For each task**:
1. **`/plan`** → Creates detailed implementation plan in `.autoflow/tasks/task-XXX/`
2. **`/build`** → Implements code following TDD (tests first, then implementation)
3. **`/code-review`** → Validates DRY, SOLID, FANG principles, security, performance
4. **Loop**: Repeat `/build` → `/code-review` until all blockers resolved (status: REVIEWFIX → REVIEW)
5. **`/test`** → Runs full test suite, verifies ≥80% coverage
6. **`/commit`** → Commits code and marks task COMPLETE

**Automated workflow** (recommended):
```bash
/auto-flow    # Orchestrates: plan → build → code-review → test → commit
```

**Task status progression**:
```
PENDING → PLANNED → REVIEW → TEST → COMPLETE
           ↓         ↓        ↓
         REVIEWFIX ←→ (automatic quality loop)
```
