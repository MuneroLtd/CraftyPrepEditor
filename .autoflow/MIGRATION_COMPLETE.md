# Migration Complete: Markdown to YAML

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: âœ… Complete

## Summary

Successfully migrated all auto-flow project files from Markdown to YAML format.

## Files Migrated

| Original (MD) | New (YAML) | Size | Records |
|---------------|------------|------|---------|
| SPRINTS.md | SPRINTS.yml | 5.5K | 7 sprints |
| TASK.md | TASK.yml | 2.0K | 2 active tasks |
| COMPLETED_TASKS.md | COMPLETED_TASKS.yml | 18K | 19 completed tasks |

## Data Integrity

âœ… All data successfully migrated:
- Project metadata preserved
- Sprint hierarchy maintained
- Task details complete
- Acceptance criteria extracted
- Documentation links preserved
- Quality metrics retained

## Backup Location

Original Markdown files backed up to:
```
.autoflow/migration-backup-md-20251006-181800/
```

## Testing

YAML files tested with `yq`:
- âœ… Query next PENDING task: `task-022`
- âœ… Get current sprint: Sprint 3 (ACTIVE)
- âœ… Count completed tasks: 10 in Sprint 1

## Example Queries

```bash
# Get next PENDING task
yq '.tasks[] | select(.status == "PENDING") | .id' .autoflow/TASK.yml | head -1

# Update task status
yq -i '(.tasks[] | select(.id == "task-022") | .status) = "PLANNED"' .autoflow/TASK.yml

# Get all sprints
yq '.sprints[] | "\(.id): \(.goal) - \(.status)"' .autoflow/SPRINTS.yml

# Count tasks by status
yq '.tasks[] | select(.status == "COMMITTED") | .id' .autoflow/COMPLETED_TASKS.yml | wc -l
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Verify auto-flow commands work with YAML files
2. âœ… Update any scripts that reference .md files
3. âœ… Delete migration script (optional)
4. âœ… Continue with `/plan`, `/build`, `/test`, etc.

## Migration Script

Location: `.autoflow/migrate_to_yaml.py`

The script can be safely deleted or kept for reference.

**Migration completed successfully!** ðŸŽ‰

The auto-flow system now uses structured YAML for data and Markdown for documentation, reducing token usage and improving query performance.
