# Acceptance Criteria: Auto-Prep Button + Processing Pipeline

**Task ID**: task-008
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-05

---

## Functional Criteria

### Auto-Prep Button Component

- [x] Component created at `src/components/AutoPrepButton.tsx`
- [ ] Button displays icon (sparkles/magic wand) + "Auto-Prep" text
- [ ] Button uses primary styling (call-to-action color)
- [ ] Button minimum size: 140px × 44px (touch-friendly)
- [ ] Disabled state when no image loaded
- [ ] Disabled state shows tooltip: "Upload an image first"
- [ ] Loading state shows spinner + "Processing..." text
- [ ] Loading state prevents double-clicks
- [ ] Click handler fires `onClick` prop

### Processing Pipeline

- [ ] Pipeline executes in order: grayscale → histogram equalization → Otsu threshold
- [ ] `convertToGrayscale` called with uploaded image ImageData
- [ ] `applyHistogramEqualization` called with grayscale result
- [ ] `calculateOptimalThreshold` calculates threshold from equalized data
- [ ] `applyOtsuThreshold` binarizes using calculated threshold
- [ ] Final result is black-and-white (binarized) image
- [ ] Pipeline is deterministic (same input → same output)
- [ ] Pipeline execution is asynchronous (doesn't block UI)

### State Management (useImageProcessing Hook)

- [ ] Hook created at `src/hooks/useImageProcessing.ts`
- [ ] Hook returns: `processedImage`, `isProcessing`, `error`, `runAutoPrepAsync`
- [ ] `isProcessing` is `true` during pipeline execution
- [ ] `isProcessing` is `false` when complete or idle
- [ ] `processedImage` is `null` initially
- [ ] `processedImage` is populated with result after successful processing
- [ ] `error` is `null` when no errors
- [ ] `error` contains user-friendly message on failure
- [ ] `runAutoPrepAsync` triggers pipeline execution

### Integration with App

- [ ] `useImageProcessing` hook imported and used in App.tsx
- [ ] AutoPrepButton rendered between FileUploadComponent and ImagePreview
- [ ] Button disabled when `uploadedImage` is null
- [ ] Button disabled when `isProcessing` is true
- [ ] Button enabled when `uploadedImage` exists and not processing
- [ ] Clicking button calls `runAutoPrepAsync(uploadedImage)`
- [ ] ImagePreview receives `processedImage` from hook
- [ ] Original image remains on left side
- [ ] Processed image displays on right side when available

### Error Handling

- [ ] Processing errors caught in try/catch
- [ ] User-friendly error messages displayed (not technical jargon)
- [ ] Error messages include actionable guidance
- [ ] Technical details logged to console for debugging
- [ ] Error state clears on next successful run
- [ ] Error doesn't crash application (graceful degradation)

### Performance

- [ ] Processing time <3 seconds for 2MB image
- [ ] Processing time <5 seconds for 5MB image
- [ ] UI remains responsive during processing (async execution)
- [ ] No UI freezing or blocking
- [ ] Memory cleaned up after processing (no leaks)
- [ ] Canvas references released properly

## Accessibility Criteria (WCAG 2.2 AAA)

### Keyboard Accessibility

- [ ] AutoPrepButton is keyboard accessible (Tab to focus)
- [ ] Button activates with Enter or Space key
- [ ] Visible focus indicator (≥3:1 contrast, ≥3px outline)
- [ ] Logical tab order maintained

### Screen Reader Support

- [ ] Button has accessible label "Auto-Prep"
- [ ] Disabled state announced: "Auto-Prep button, disabled"
- [ ] Loading state announced: "Processing image"
- [ ] Processing completion announced: "Image processing complete"
- [ ] Error state announced: "Error: [message]"
- [ ] aria-live region for status updates
- [ ] aria-busy attribute during processing

### Visual Design

- [ ] Color contrast ≥7:1 for text (AAA)
- [ ] Color contrast ≥3:1 for button boundary
- [ ] Information not conveyed by color alone
- [ ] Button size ≥44px × 44px (touch target)
- [ ] Disabled state visually distinct (reduced opacity/grayscale)
- [ ] Loading spinner visible and animated

---

## Testing Criteria

### Unit Tests (≥80% Coverage)

**AutoPrepButton Component**:
- [ ] Renders with correct text and icon
- [ ] Disabled prop disables button
- [ ] Loading prop shows spinner and changes text
- [ ] onClick handler fires when clicked
- [ ] Accessible attributes present (aria-label, role)
- [ ] Keyboard interaction works (Enter/Space)

**useImageProcessing Hook**:
- [ ] Initial state correct (null image, false processing, null error)
- [ ] `runAutoPrepAsync` sets isProcessing to true
- [ ] Pipeline functions called in order
- [ ] `processedImage` populated after success
- [ ] `isProcessing` set to false after completion
- [ ] Error state set on failure
- [ ] Error cleared on next successful run

### Integration Tests

**Complete Pipeline Flow**:
- [ ] Upload image → Click Auto-Prep → See processed result
- [ ] Processing time measured and within targets
- [ ] Multiple runs work correctly (state resets)
- [ ] Error scenarios handled (e.g., corrupted ImageData)
- [ ] Original and processed images display side-by-side
- [ ] Zoom/pan works on processed image
