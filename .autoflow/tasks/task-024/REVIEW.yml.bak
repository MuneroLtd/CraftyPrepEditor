    acceptance_criteria_ref: "Section 5: Resizable Panel"
    description: |
      ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VIOLATION:

      Section 5 "Resizable Panel" requires:
      - [ ] Resize handle visible on panel edge (4px wide)
      - [ ] Resize handle has hover state (changes cursor to col-resize)
      - [ ] Resize handle is ≥44px tall at multiple points (touch-friendly)
      - [ ] Dragging handle resizes panel smoothly (no lag)
      - [ ] Resize respects min/max width constraints
      - [ ] Resize updates in real-time (not just on mouse up)
      - [ ] Final width saved to localStorage on drag end
      - [ ] Keyboard: Left/Right arrows resize panel (10px increments)
      - [ ] Resize handle has ARIA label "Resize panel"
      - [ ] Resize handle announces current width to screen readers

      CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
      - Right panel width is read from preferences.rightPanelWidth (line 159)
      - Width is applied via inline style
      - NO resize handle component exists
      - NO drag handlers implemented
      - NO keyboard resize support
      - Width can ONLY be changed by editing localStorage manually

      This is a complete omission of a core acceptance criterion.

    expected: |
      Implement full panel resize functionality:

      1. Create ResizeHandle component:
         - 4px wide vertical bar on left edge of right panel
         - Hover cursor: col-resize
         - Touch targets ≥44px tall (multiple grab points)
         - ARIA label: "Resize panel"
         - ARIA role: "separator"
         - ARIA valuenow/valuemin/valuemax for current width

      2. Implement drag handlers:
         - mousedown/mousemove/mouseup for desktop
         - touchstart/touchmove/touchend for mobile
         - Update width in real-time during drag
         - Clamp to MIN_PANEL_WIDTH (200px) and MAX_PANEL_WIDTH (600px)
         - Save final width to localStorage on drag end

      3. Implement keyboard resize:
         - Focus on resize handle
         - Left arrow: decrease width by 10px
         - Right arrow: increase width by 10px
         - Home: set to MIN_PANEL_WIDTH
         - End: set to MAX_PANEL_WIDTH
         - Announce width changes to screen readers

      4. Performance optimization:
         - Throttle width updates during drag (16ms for 60fps)
         - Debounce localStorage save (300ms after drag end)

    fix_required:
      - Create src/components/layout/ResizeHandle.tsx component
      - Add resize handle to EditorLayout between canvas and right panel
      - Implement useResize hook for drag/keyboard logic
      - Add width state management to EditorLayout
      - Update useLayoutPreferences to handle width updates
      - Add unit tests for ResizeHandle component
      - Add E2E tests for resize interactions
      - Verify WCAG 2.2 AAA compliance (touch targets, keyboard, screen reader)

      - src/hooks/useLayoutPreferences.ts:14,78-82 (width validation)
      - src/hooks/useLayoutPreferences.ts:28-30 (MIN/MAX constants)

    estimated_effort: 4-6 hours
    priority: HIGH (blocks acceptance criteria completion)
    resolution: |

    acceptance_criteria_ref: "Section 7: Responsive Behavior"
    description: |
      ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VIOLATION:

      Section 7 "Responsive Behavior" requires:

      TABLET (768px - 1023px):
      - [ ] Top toolbar visible
      - [ ] Left sidebar collapses to icon-only (60px)
      - [ ] Right panel hidden by default (can be toggled)
      - [ ] Canvas takes remaining space
      - [ ] Status bar visible

      MOBILE (<768px):
      - [ ] Top toolbar replaced by hamburger menu
      - [ ] Left sidebar hidden (accessible via hamburger)
      - [ ] Right panel hidden (accessible via floating button)
      - [ ] Canvas takes full width

      This violates the entire Section 7 acceptance criteria.

    expected: |
      Implement full responsive behavior:

      1. Create useMediaQuery hook:
         - Detect screen size breakpoints (mobile: <768px, tablet: 768-1023px, desktop: ≥1024px)
         - Return { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop }
         - Use window.matchMedia with listeners
         - Clean up listeners on unmount

      2. Desktop (≥1024px) - CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
         - All panels visible by default
         - Full toolbar with dropdown menus
         - Right panel width 400px (resizable)

      3. Tablet (768-1023px):
         - Auto-hide right panel (can toggle via View menu or Ctrl+1)
         - Left sidebar: keep visible but reduce to icon-only (60px width)

         - StatusBar: show only status message and dimensions (hide tips)
         - Panels become overlays (position: fixed, z-index) instead of layout columns

      5. Smooth transitions:
         - CSS transitions for panel visibility
         - No layout shift or content flash
         - Preserve panel states in localStorage per breakpoint

    fix_required:
      - Create src/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts hook

    - NOT REVIEWED (would be in /test command)

  overall_testing_score: 90/100
  testing_concerns:
    - Tests will need updates for resize functionality
    - Tests will need updates for responsive behavior

strengths:
  - Excellent TypeScript typing throughout
  - Strong security (prototype pollution prevention)
  - Good SOLID principle adherence
  - Comprehensive localStorage validation
  - Proper ARIA roles and keyboard shortcuts
  - Well-tested code (unit tests present)
  - Clean component architecture
  - Performance optimizations (memo, useCallback, debouncing)
  - Good separation of concerns
  - Platform-aware keyboard shortcuts (Mac vs Windows)

weaknesses:
  - Missing panel resize functionality (acceptance criteria violation)
  - Missing responsive layout behavior (acceptance criteria violation)
  - No user feedback for localStorage failures
  - No smooth animations for CollapsibleSection
  - No ARIA live announcements for panel visibility changes

next_actions:
  required:
    - Fix LAYOUT-R5-001: Implement panel resize functionality
    - Fix LAYOUT-R5-002: Implement responsive layout behavior

  recommended:
    - Add user feedback for localStorage failures (toast/banner)
    - Add smooth animations to CollapsibleSection (CSS transitions)
    - Add ARIA live announcements for panel visibility toggles

  MARK AS REVIEWFIX

  The implementation quality is EXCELLENT from a code quality, security, and architecture
  perspective. All previous review issues have been properly resolved.

  HOWEVER, two CRITICAL acceptance criteria are completely missing:

  1. Panel resize functionality (Section 5 of acceptance criteria)
     - No resize handle component
     - No drag interaction
     - No keyboard resize support
     - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

  2. Responsive layout behavior (Section 7 of acceptance criteria)
     - No tablet/mobile adaptations
     - Layout is unusable on mobile devices
     - No hamburger menu
     - Estimated effort: 6-8 hours

  These are not minor issues - they represent 10-14 hours of missing work from the
  original task estimation of 14 hours. The task is approximately 30-40% incomplete.

  RECOMMENDATION:
  1. Status: REVIEWFIX (not TEST - missing features must be built first)
  2. Priority: Both issues are HIGH severity
  3. Next step: Run /review-fix to implement missing features
  4. After fixes: Re-run /code-review to verify implementation
  5. Then: Proceed to /test

scores:
  code_quality: 92/100
  security: 95/100
  performance: 88/100
  accessibility: 87/100
  completeness: 60/100  # Due to missing acceptance criteria features
  overall: 84/100

completion_status:
  implemented_features: 6/8 sections
  missing_features: 2/8 sections (Resizable Panel, Responsive Behavior)
  acceptance_criteria_met: 60%
