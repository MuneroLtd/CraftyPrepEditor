# Acceptance Criteria: Background Removal Integration

**Task ID**: task-013
**Feature**: Automatic Background Removal with Manual Sensitivity Control

## Functional Acceptance Criteria

### Background Removal Algorithm
- [ ] Detects background using edge detection and flood-fill algorithm
- [ ] Samples background color from image corners (auto-detection)
- [ ] Removes background by setting matching pixels to transparent (alpha = 0)
- [ ] Preserves foreground content (non-background pixels)
- [ ] Handles solid and near-solid backgrounds correctly
- [ ] Tolerance threshold controls sensitivity (0-255 range)

### Pipeline Integration
- [ ] Background removal applied after grayscale conversion
- [ ] Background removal applied before histogram equalization
- [ ] Alpha channel preserved through histogram equalization
- [ ] Alpha channel preserved through threshold application
- [ ] Alpha channel preserved through brightness/contrast adjustments
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline produces RGBA ImageData with transparency

### UI Controls
- [ ] "Remove Background" toggle visible in refinement controls
- [ ] Toggle enables/disables background removal feature
- [ ] Sensitivity slider visible when toggle is enabled
- [ ] Sensitivity slider ranges from 0 to 255
- [ ] Sensitivity slider default value is 128 (mid-range)
- [ ] Slider step size is 1
- [ ] Current sensitivity value displayed next to slider label
- [ ] Slider positioned before brightness/contrast/threshold (logical pipeline order)

### User Interaction
- [ ] Toggling background removal on triggers processing
- [ ] Toggling background removal off restores non-transparent result
- [ ] Adjusting sensitivity slider updates preview in real-time
- [ ] Slider updates debounced to 100ms (prevents excessive processing)
- [ ] Preview shows transparent areas with checkerboard pattern behind image
- [ ] Visual indicator shows when background removal is active
- [ ] Reset button returns sensitivity to default (128) and disables toggle

### Export Functionality
- [ ] Downloaded PNG includes alpha channel (transparency preserved)
- [ ] Transparent areas in PNG are actually transparent (not white)
- [ ] PNG export works correctly with background removal enabled
- [ ] PNG export works correctly with background removal disabled
- [ ] Downloaded file matches preview exactly (WYSIWYG)

## Technical Acceptance Criteria

### Algorithm Implementation
- [ ] Edge detection using Sobel operator implemented correctly
- [ ] Background color sampling from corners (4 corners, most common color)
- [ ] Flood-fill uses queue-based approach (no recursion)
- [ ] Flood-fill handles tolerance threshold correctly
- [ ] Flood-fill marks visited pixels to prevent infinite loops
- [ ] Memory efficient (visited array cleanup after processing)
- [ ] Color comparison uses Euclidean distance in RGB space
- [ ] Early termination when tolerance exceeded

### Code Quality
- [ ] All code follows DRY principles (no duplication)
- [ ] SOLID principles applied (single responsibility, etc.)
- [ ] TypeScript types defined for all functions and components
- [ ] JSDoc comments on all public functions
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases (all same color, no background, etc.)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Code passes ESLint with no violations
- [ ] Code passes TypeScript type checking

### Testing Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for edge detection function (≥90% coverage)
- [ ] Unit tests for background color detection (≥90% coverage)
- [ ] Unit tests for flood-fill algorithm (≥90% coverage)
- [ ] Unit tests for removeBackground function (≥90% coverage)
- [ ] Unit tests for BackgroundRemovalControl component
- [ ] Unit tests for useBackgroundRemoval hook
- [ ] Integration tests for pipeline with background removal
- [ ] Integration tests for alpha channel preservation
- [ ] E2E tests for full user workflow (upload → enable → adjust → download)
- [ ] E2E test verifies PNG export has alpha channel

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Slider response time <100ms after drag stops
- [ ] 2MB image processing completes in <500ms
- [ ] UI remains responsive during processing (no blocking)
- [ ] Memory usage <10MB additional for flood-fill
- [ ] No memory leaks (cleanup after processing)
- [ ] Debouncing prevents excessive re-processing

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Level AAA)
- [ ] Toggle has proper ARIA role and label
- [ ] Slider has ARIA label, min, max, and value
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab to focus, Space/Enter to toggle)
- [ ] Arrow keys adjust slider value
- [ ] Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements (≥3:1 contrast, ≥3px)
- [ ] Screen reader announces toggle state (on/off)
- [ ] Screen reader announces slider value changes
- [ ] Touch targets ≥44×44px on mobile
- [ ] No reliance on color alone for state indication
- [ ] Color contrast meets AAA standards (≥7:1 for text)

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Works in Chrome 90+ (latest)
- [ ] Works in Firefox 88+ (latest)
- [ ] Works in Safari 14+ (latest)
- [ ] Works in Edge 90+ (latest)
- [ ] Canvas RGBA support verified in all browsers
- [ ] PNG alpha export verified in all browsers

## Edge Cases Handled

### Image Variations
- [ ] Image with no clear background (complex scene) - graceful degradation
- [ ] Image with gradient background - partial removal based on tolerance
- [ ] Image already has transparency (PNG with alpha) - preserved
- [ ] All-white image - handled without errors
- [ ] All-black image - handled without errors
- [ ] Very small image (100×100) - works correctly
- [ ] Very large image (5000×5000) - works within performance targets

### User Input Edge Cases
- [ ] Sensitivity = 0 (minimal removal) - only exact matches removed
- [ ] Sensitivity = 255 (maximum removal) - aggressive removal
- [ ] Rapid slider adjustments - debounced correctly
- [ ] Toggle on/off repeatedly - no errors or memory leaks
- [ ] Enable background removal on already processed image - works correctly
- [ ] Disable background removal - restores non-transparent result

### Pipeline Edge Cases
- [ ] Background removal with brightness = +100 - transparency preserved
- [ ] Background removal with contrast = -100 - transparency preserved
- [ ] Background removal with threshold = 0 - transparency preserved
- [ ] Background removal with all adjustments at extremes - works correctly
- [ ] Reset after background removal - restores to auto-prep default (bg removal off)

**Verification Method**:
1. Run all tests: `npm test && npm run test:e2e`
2. Manual testing: Upload image with white background, enable removal, adjust sensitivity, verify transparency in preview, download and verify PNG alpha
3. Accessibility audit: Run Lighthouse, verify score ≥95
4. Performance test: Measure slider response time (<100ms), processing time (<500ms for 2MB)
