## Design Pattern: Command Pattern

### Overview

The **Command Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to:
- Parameterize objects with operations
- Queue operations
- Log operations
- Support undoable operations

For undo/redo functionality, the Command Pattern is ideal because it:
- Stores each state change as a discrete command/snapshot
- Maintains a history stack of executed commands
- Allows reversing commands (undo) by restoring previous state
- Allows re-executing commands (redo) by moving forward in history

### Implementation Approach

We're using a **simplified Command Pattern** that stores **immutable state snapshots** rather than executable command objects.

**Why Snapshots Instead of Commands?**
1. **Simplicity**: State is just 4 numbers (brightness, contrast, threshold) + 1 string (preset)
2. **Memory Efficient**: ~100 bytes per snapshot vs. complex command objects
3. **No Side Effects**: Pure state restoration (no command execution logic)
4. **Easier to Test**: Simple equality checks, no mock command execution

**Traditional Command Pattern** (not used):
```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void;
  undo(): void;
}

class BrightnessCommand implements Command {
  constructor(
    private previousValue: number,
    private newValue: number,
    private setter: (value: number) => void
  ) {}

  execute() { this.setter(this.newValue); }
  undo() { this.setter(this.previousValue); }
}
```

**Our Snapshot Approach** (used):
```typescript
interface HistoryState {
  brightness: number;
  contrast: number;
  threshold: number;
  preset: MaterialPresetName;
}

// Store snapshots in array
const history: HistoryState[] = [...];

// Undo = restore previous snapshot
function undo() {
  const previousState = history[currentIndex - 1];
  restoreState(previousState);
}
```

**Trade-off**: Snapshots consume slightly more memory (all 4 values even if only 1 changed), but gain simplicity and type safety.

## History Stack Design

### Stack Structure

```typescript
interface UseHistoryReturn {
  history: HistoryState[];          // Array of state snapshots
  currentIndex: number;             // Pointer to current state
  canUndo: boolean;                 // currentIndex > 0
  canRedo: boolean;                 // currentIndex < history.length - 1
  push: (state: HistoryState) => void;
  undo: () => HistoryState | null;
  redo: () => HistoryState | null;
  clear: () => void;
}
```

### Stack Operations

#### 1. Push (Add New State)

```
Before: [A, B, C]    currentIndex = 2
Push D

After:  [A, B, C, D] currentIndex = 3
```

**Edge Case: Undo Then Push (Truncates Redo Stack)**
```
Before: [A, B, C, D, E]  currentIndex = 2 (undone 2 times)
Push F

After:  [A, B, C, F]     currentIndex = 3 (D, E discarded)
```

**Edge Case: Max Capacity (10 States)**
```
Before: [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J]  currentIndex = 9 (10 states)
Push K

After:  [B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]  currentIndex = 9 (A discarded)
```

#### 2. Undo (Move Back)

```
Before: [A, B, C, D] currentIndex = 3
Undo

After:  [A, B, C, D] currentIndex = 2 (returns C)
```

**Returns the state at the new index** (C), which is the previous state.

#### 3. Redo (Move Forward)

```
Before: [A, B, C, D] currentIndex = 2 (undone once)
Redo

After:  [A, B, C, D] currentIndex = 3 (returns D)
```

**Returns the state at the new index** (D), which is the next state.

#### 4. Clear (Reset)

```
Before: [A, B, C, D] currentIndex = 3
Clear

After:  []           currentIndex = -1
```

## State Snapshot Strategy

### What to Store

**Included in Snapshot**:
- ✅ `brightness: number` (-100 to 100)
- ✅ `contrast: number` (-100 to 100)
- ✅ `threshold: number` (0 to 255)
- ✅ `preset: MaterialPresetName` ('auto' | 'wood' | 'leather' | 'acrylic' | 'glass' | 'metal' | 'custom')

**NOT Included in Snapshot**:
- ❌ `baselineImageData: ImageData` (too large, ~8MB for 1920x1080 image)
- ❌ `processedImage: HTMLImageElement` (derived from state, can be regenerated)
- ❌ `processedCanvas: HTMLCanvasElement` (derived from state, can be regenerated)
- ❌ `uploadedImage: HTMLImageElement` (constant, doesn't change during adjustments)

**Memory Calculation**:
```
Per snapshot:
- brightness: 8 bytes (number)
- contrast: 8 bytes (number)
- threshold: 8 bytes (number)
- preset: ~20 bytes (string)
Total: ~44 bytes per snapshot

Max 10 snapshots: ~440 bytes total

Compare to storing ImageData:
- 1920x1080 RGBA: 1920 * 1080 * 4 = 8,294,400 bytes (~8MB)
- 10 snapshots: ~83MB (REJECTED - too large!)
```

**Conclusion**: Storing only numbers and strings is extremely memory efficient.

## Integration with Existing State Management

### Current State Flow (Before Undo/Redo)

```
1. User adjusts slider
   ↓
2. setState(newValue)
   ↓
3. Debounce (100ms)
   ↓
4. useEffect detects debounced value change
   ↓
5. applyAdjustments(brightness, contrast, threshold)
   ↓
6. Processed image updates
```

### New State Flow (With Undo/Redo)

```
1. User adjusts slider
   ↓
2. setState(newValue)
   ↓
3. Debounce (100ms)
   ↓
4. useEffect detects debounced value change
   ↓
4a. pushHistory({ brightness, contrast, threshold, preset })  ← NEW
   ↓
5. applyAdjustments(brightness, contrast, threshold)
   ↓
6. Processed image updates
```

**Key Insight**: History push happens AFTER debounce completes, preventing rapid slider movements from polluting history.

### Undo/Redo State Flow

```
User clicks Undo (or Ctrl+Z)
   ↓
undoHistory() → returns previousState
   ↓
setBrightness(previousState.brightness)
setContrast(previousState.contrast)
setThreshold(previousState.threshold)
setSelectedPreset(previousState.preset)
   ↓
useEffect detects state change
   ↓
applyAdjustments(brightness, contrast, threshold)
   ↓
Processed image updates
```

**Key Insight**: Undo/redo doesn't directly trigger image processing. It just updates state, and existing useEffect handles the rest.

## Keyboard Shortcuts Research

### Standard Keyboard Conventions

**Windows/Linux**:
- Undo: `Ctrl+Z`
- Redo: `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z`

**macOS**:
- Undo: `Cmd+Z` (⌘Z)
- Redo: `Cmd+Shift+Z` (⌘⇧Z) or `Cmd+Y` (⌘Y)

**Implementation**: Support both `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) and `Cmd` (Mac) via `e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey`

### Event Listener Strategy

**Global Listener** (on `window`):
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    const isModifier = e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey;

    // Prevent conflicts with text inputs
    if (e.target instanceof HTMLInputElement || e.target instanceof HTMLTextAreaElement) {
      return;
    }

    if (isModifier && e.key === 'z') {
      e.preventDefault();
      handleUndo();
    } else if (isModifier && e.key === 'y') {
      e.preventDefault();
      handleRedo();
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [handleUndo, handleRedo]);
```

**Why Global Listener?**
- Keyboard shortcuts should work anywhere in the app
- Users don't need to focus on a specific element
- Prevents need for focus management

**Conflict Prevention**:
- Check `e.target` to avoid triggering when user is typing in input fields
- Use `e.preventDefault()` to prevent browser's native undo (in text inputs)

## Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG 2.2 Level AAA Requirements

#### 1. Keyboard Accessibility
- [x] Buttons are keyboard focusable (Tab key)
- [x] Enter/Space activates buttons
- [x] Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y work globally
- [x] Focus indicators visible (≥3px outline, ≥3:1 contrast)

#### 2. Screen Reader Support
- [x] Clear aria-label: "Undo last adjustment (Ctrl+Z)"
- [x] Disabled state announced: "Undo, button, disabled"
- [x] State changes announced via live regions (optional enhancement)

#### 3. Visual Accessibility
- [x] Button text ≥7:1 contrast (AAA standard)
- [x] Disabled button ≥4.5:1 contrast
- [x] Icons are supplementary (text labels present)
- [x] Touch targets ≥44×44px

#### 4. Motion Sensitivity
- [x] Slider animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [x] No auto-playing animations

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use `aria-label` for full context (includes keyboard shortcut)
- Use `title` attribute for hover tooltip
- Use `disabled` attribute for proper screen reader announcement

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Store ImageData in History
**Pros**: Instant undo (no re-processing)
**Cons**: ~8MB per snapshot × 10 = 80MB memory usage
**Decision**: REJECTED - memory cost too high

### Alternative 2: Store Deltas (Incremental Changes)
**Example**: Store "brightness +5" instead of full state
**Pros**: Minimal memory
**Cons**: Complex to implement, error-prone, harder to test
**Decision**: REJECTED - added complexity not justified for 4 values

### Alternative 3: Infinite History (No Limit)
**Pros**: Never lose undo history
**Cons**: Memory grows unbounded, potential memory leaks
**Decision**: REJECTED - 10 states is industry standard (Photoshop, Figma use similar limits)

### Alternative 4: Command Objects (Traditional Command Pattern)
**Example**: Each adjustment creates a Command object with execute() and undo()
**Pros**: Classic design pattern, extensible
**Cons**: Overkill for simple state snapshots
**Decision**: REJECTED - snapshots are simpler and sufficient

---

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- **Per Snapshot**: ~44 bytes
- **Max History**: ~440 bytes
- **Impact**: Negligible (less than loading a single icon)

### CPU Usage
- **Push Operation**: O(1) - array append
- **Undo/Redo**: O(1) - array index access
- **Clear**: O(1) - array reset
- **State Restoration**: O(1) - set 4 state variables

**Bottleneck**: Image re-processing (not history operations)
- `applyAdjustments()` takes ~100-500ms for 2MP image
- History operations take <1ms

### Optimization Strategy
**No optimization needed** - History operations are already O(1) and instant.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (useHistory Hook)
**Test Cases**:
1. Initialize with empty history
2. Push state to history
3. Undo to previous state
4. Redo to next state
5. Clear history
6. Max capacity (10 states) - oldest dropped
7. Undo then push - redo stack truncated
8. Edge cases: undo when empty, redo when at end

**Coverage Target**: ≥90% (critical utility)

### Integration Tests
**Test Cases**:
1. Adjust slider → push to history
2. Undo → state restored, image updated
3. Redo → state re-applied, image updated
4. Auto-prep → history cleared
5. Reset → history cleared
6. Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)

**Coverage Target**: ≥80%

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
**Test Cases**:
1. User uploads image, adjusts sliders, clicks undo, verifies image changed
2. User presses Ctrl+Z, verifies undo worked
3. User presses Ctrl+Y, verifies redo worked
4. Buttons are disabled at appropriate times
5. Screen reader announces button states

**Coverage Target**: All critical user flows

## Implementation Risks

### Risk 1: State Update Race Conditions
**Description**: Undo might conflict with in-progress debounced updates
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**: React's state batching handles this naturally
**Fallback**: Add flag to prevent pushing during undo/redo

### Risk 2: History Pollution from Rapid Slider Movements
**Description**: Every slider movement might push to history
**Likelihood**: Low (debouncing prevents this)
**Mitigation**: Only push on debounced value changes (100ms)
**Verification**: Test rapid slider movements, confirm only final value is in history

### Risk 3: Memory Leaks
**Description**: History entries not garbage collected
**Likelihood**: Very Low
**Mitigation**: Use primitive types (numbers, strings) - automatically GC'd
**Verification**: Chrome DevTools memory profiler

## Benchmarking

### Expected Performance Metrics

| Operation | Target | Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Push to history | <1ms | <5ms |
| Undo | <1ms | <5ms |
| Redo | <1ms | <5ms |
| Clear | <1ms | <5ms |
| Image re-processing after undo | <100ms | <500ms |

**Note**: Image re-processing is the bottleneck, not history operations.
