## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Optimal Threshold Calculation
**Criterion**: System calculates optimal threshold using Otsu's method
- [ ] Histogram of grayscale image is calculated correctly (256 bins)
- [ ] Probability distribution computed from histogram
- [ ] Between-class variance computed for each threshold value (0-255)
- [ ] Threshold with maximum variance is selected
- [ ] Threshold value is returned as integer (0-255)

**Verification**: Unit test with synthetic bimodal image with known optimal threshold

---

### FR-2: Binarization
**Criterion**: Image is correctly binarized using optimal threshold
- [ ] Pixels with intensity < threshold are set to 0 (black)
- [ ] Pixels with intensity ≥ threshold are set to 255 (white)
- [ ] Output is pure black and white (only 0 and 255 values)
- [ ] Alpha channel preserved at 255 (fully opaque)

**Verification**: Unit test verifying output contains only 0 and 255 values

---

### FR-3: ImageData Preservation
**Criterion**: Output ImageData maintains correct structure
- [ ] Width matches input ImageData
- [ ] Height matches input ImageData
- [ ] Data array length = width × height × 4
- [ ] RGBA format preserved

**Verification**: Unit test checking dimensions and data length

## Edge Cases

### EC-1: All-Black Image
**Criterion**: Handles image with all pixels = 0
- [ ] Function doesn't crash
- [ ] Returns valid threshold (0 or 1)
- [ ] Binarized output is all-black

**Verification**: Unit test with all-black ImageData

---

### EC-2: All-White Image
**Criterion**: Handles image with all pixels = 255
- [ ] Function doesn't crash
- [ ] Returns valid threshold (254 or 255)
- [ ] Binarized output is all-white

**Verification**: Unit test with all-white ImageData

---

### EC-3: Uniform Gray Image
**Criterion**: Handles image with all pixels = same value
- [ ] Function doesn't crash
- [ ] Returns valid threshold (approximately mid-range)
- [ ] Binarized output is uniform (all black or all white)

**Verification**: Unit test with uniform gray ImageData

---

### EC-4: Low-Contrast Image
**Criterion**: Handles image with narrow intensity range
- [ ] Function doesn't crash
- [ ] Returns valid threshold within intensity range
- [ ] Produces reasonable binarization

**Verification**: Unit test with low-contrast ImageData (e.g., 120-135)

---

### EC-5: High-Contrast Image
**Criterion**: Handles image already near-binary
- [ ] Function doesn't crash
- [ ] Returns optimal threshold separating two peaks
- [ ] Binarization preserves existing contrast

**Verification**: Unit test with high-contrast bimodal ImageData

- [ ] Histogram calculation: <100ms
- [ ] Variance calculations: <500ms
- [ ] Binarization: <500ms

**Criterion**: Minimal memory overhead
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Output ImageData created efficiently
- [ ] Temporary arrays cleaned up

**Verification**: Manual verification with browser DevTools memory profiler

## Quality Requirements

### QUAL-1: Deterministic Behavior
**Criterion**: Same input always produces same output
- [ ] Running function multiple times with same input produces identical results
- [ ] No randomness or non-deterministic behavior
- [ ] Threshold value is consistent

**Verification**: Unit test running function 100 times with same input

---

### QUAL-2: Pure Functions
**Criterion**: Functions have no side effects
- [ ] Input ImageData is not modified
- [ ] No global state changes
- [ ] Output is new ImageData object

**Verification**: Unit test verifying input ImageData unchanged after function call

---

### QUAL-3: Type Safety
**Criterion**: TypeScript types are correct and comprehensive
- [ ] Input parameter typed as `ImageData`
- [ ] Return type specified explicitly
- [ ] No `any` types used

## Acceptance Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bimodal Image
**Given**: Grayscale image with two distinct intensity peaks (e.g., 50 and 200)
**When**: `applyOtsuThreshold()` is called
**Then**:
- Threshold is calculated near the valley between peaks (~125)
- Output is binarized with clear separation

---

### Scenario 2: Document Scan
**Given**: Scanned document with text on white background
**When**: `applyOtsuThreshold()` is called
**Then**:
- Text becomes pure black (0)
- Background becomes pure white (255)
- Text remains readable

### Scenario 3: Photo with Foreground/Background
**Given**: Photo with clear foreground subject and background
**When**: `applyOtsuThreshold()` is called
**Then**:
