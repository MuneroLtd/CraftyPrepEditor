# Acceptance Criteria: Professional Control Panel Redesign

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Control Panel Structure
- [ ] Control panels use card/panel components with border, shadow, and rounded corners
- [ ] Panel has clear heading: "Controls"
- [ ] Panel uses consistent padding (24px via PANEL.padding token)
- [ ] Panel has proper ARIA region role with label

### FR2: Collapsible Sections
- [ ] All control sections have collapse/expand functionality
- [ ] Section headers display chevron icon indicating expand/collapse state
- [ ] Chevron rotates smoothly when toggling (180deg rotation)
- [ ] Multiple sections can be open simultaneously (not exclusive)
- [ ] Clicking header toggles section visibility

### FR3: Section Organization
- [ ] **Material Presets** section contains MaterialPresetSelector
- [ ] **Background Removal** section contains BackgroundRemovalControl (toggle + sensitivity slider)
- [ ] **Adjustments** section groups Brightness, Contrast, and Threshold sliders together
- [ ] **History** section contains Undo/Redo buttons
- [ ] **Export** section contains Download button
- [ ] **Actions** section contains Reset button
- [ ] Sections follow logical order (pipeline order: presets → background → adjustments → history → export → actions)

### FR4: Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] Main heading ("Controls") uses text-xl font-semibold
- [ ] Section headers use font-medium
- [ ] Each section has rounded border (rounded-lg)
- [ ] Sections have hover state (background color change to muted/50)
- [ ] Visual separators between sections (2px spacing via space-y-2)
- [ ] Content has appropriate padding (px-4 pb-4 pt-2)

### FR5: Consistent Spacing
- [ ] Panel outer padding: 24px (p-6)
- [ ] Section spacing: 8px (space-y-2)
- [ ] Content spacing: 16px (space-y-4 for sliders)
- [ ] Header padding: 12px horizontal, 12px vertical (px-4 py-3)
- [ ] All spacing uses 8px grid system (SPACING tokens)

### FR6: Smooth Animations
- [ ] Expand animation duration: 300ms (ANIMATION.durations.medium)
- [ ] Collapse animation duration: 300ms
- [ ] Animation easing: ease-out (ANIMATION.easings.out)
- [ ] Chevron rotation animates smoothly
- [ ] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion setting
- [ ] No jank or stuttering during animations (60fps target)

### FR7: State Persistence
- [ ] Panel state (expanded/collapsed for each section) saves to localStorage
- [ ] State persists across page reloads
- [ ] State persists across sessions
- [ ] Invalid state data handled gracefully (fallback to defaults)
- [ ] localStorage unavailable handled gracefully (no errors)
- [ ] Storage key: 'craftyprep_panel_state'

### FR8: Default State
- [ ] All sections expanded by default for first-time users
- [ ] User's previous state restored on subsequent visits
- [ ] Default state shows all controls (no hidden functionality)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Level AAA)
- [ ] All sections have proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls)
- [ ] Accordion triggers are focusable buttons
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works:
  - [ ] Tab/Shift+Tab moves between section triggers
  - [ ] Enter/Space toggles section
  - [ ] Arrow keys work within sliders
- [ ] Focus indicators visible (≥3px, ≥3:1 contrast)
- [ ] Screen readers announce:
  - [ ] Section headers
  - [ ] Expand/collapse state
  - [ ] Number of items in each section
- [ ] Color contrast ≥7:1 for text (AAA)
- [ ] Touch targets ≥44px × 44px (AAA)
- [ ] No functionality depends solely on color
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (h2 for main, buttons for sections)

### NFR2: Performance
- [ ] Component renders in <16ms (60fps)
- [ ] State updates debounced appropriately
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (React.memo used)
- [ ] localStorage operations don't block UI
- [ ] Smooth animations on target devices (no jank)
- [ ] Bundle size impact <10KB (gzipped)

### NFR3: Responsive Design
- [ ] Works on mobile (320px - 767px)
- [ ] Works on tablet (768px - 1023px)
- [ ] Works on desktop (1024px+)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling at any viewport width
- [ ] Touch-friendly on mobile (≥44px tap targets)
- [ ] Proper spacing adjustments for mobile
- [ ] Readable at all sizes (no text truncation)

### NFR4: Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome 90+ (latest): Full support
- [ ] Firefox 88+ (latest): Full support
- [ ] Safari 14+ (latest): Full support
- [ ] Edge 90+ (latest): Full support
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS 14+): Full support
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android 10+): Full support

### NFR5: Code Quality
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
- [ ] All props documented with JSDoc
- [ ] Component memoized (React.memo)
- [ ] Unit test coverage ≥80%
- [ ] Integration tests for state persistence
- [ ] E2E tests for user interactions
- [ ] No ESLint errors
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

### NFR6: Maintainability
- [ ] Follows existing component patterns (composition)
- [ ] Uses existing design tokens (no magic numbers)
- [ ] Reuses existing control components (no duplication)
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns (layout vs. logic)
- [ ] Single source of truth for state
- [ ] Well-documented technical decisions
- [ ] Easy to add new sections in future

**Total Criteria**: 72 acceptance criteria across all categories

**Status**: PENDING (will be updated during implementation)

**Notes**:
- All criteria must be met before marking task COMPLETE
- Any blockers must be documented and resolved
- Testing should be comprehensive (unit, integration, E2E, accessibility)
- Implementation must maintain full backward compatibility with existing features
