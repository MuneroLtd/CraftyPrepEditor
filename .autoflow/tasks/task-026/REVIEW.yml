- URL: https://craftyprep.demosrv.uk
- Browser: Chromium (Playwright)
- Test Date: 2025-10-07

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ 1. Custom slider component with styled track and handle
**Status**: PASSED

## Performance Notes

- Slider interactions are responsive (<100ms feedback)
- No lag during value changes
- Smooth gradient animations
- Real-time processing integration working efficiently

## Conclusion

**VERIFICATION STATUS: PASSED ✅**

All 9 acceptance criteria have been verified and confirmed working correctly. The enhanced slider components represent a significant improvement over basic HTML sliders:

1. **Visual Design**: Professional, modern appearance with gradient fills
