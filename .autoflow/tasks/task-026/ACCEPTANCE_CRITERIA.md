**Given** the user interacts with any slider in the application
**When** the slider is rendered
**Then**:
- The track is 8px tall with rounded ends
- The unfilled portion has a light gray background
- The filled portion displays a gradient (color varies by slider type)

### AC2: Gradient Fill Shows Current Value Position

**Given** the user adjusts a slider
**When** the slider value changes
**Then**:
- The gradient fill extends from the start to the current handle position
- The fill percentage accurately reflects the value relative to min/max
- The gradient colors transition smoothly (no banding)
- The gradient is appropriate for the slider type:
  - Brightness: Blue gradient (dark to light)
  - Contrast: Purple gradient (low to high)
  - Threshold: Gray to white gradient

**Validation**:
- Unit test: Gradient percentage calculation for min, mid, max values
- Visual test: Gradient appearance at various positions
- E2E test: Drag slider and verify fill updates

### AC3: Inline Value Display (No Separate Label)

**Given** the user hovers over or drags a slider
**When** the interaction occurs
**Then**:
- A floating badge appears above the handle
- The badge displays the current numeric value
- The badge has a colored background matching the slider theme
- The badge fades in smoothly (200ms transition)
- The badge remains visible during drag operations
- The badge fades out 500ms after hover/drag ends

**Validation**:
- Unit test: Badge visibility states

---

### AC4: Numeric Input with Validation

**Given** the user wants to enter a precise value
**When** the numeric input field is available
**Then**:

- Value badge fades in
- Transition duration: 200ms

**Focus**:
- Handle shows 3px ring in accent color
- Ring contrast meets WCAG AAA (≥3:1)
- Ring is clearly visible

**Active/Dragging**:
- Handle scales to 1.15
- Handle shadow strengthens (0 4px 8px)
- Value badge always visible
- Track brightens slightly

**Transitions**:
- All state changes use smooth easing
- Duration: 200-300ms
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

**Validation**:
- Visual test: Hover state appearance
- Visual test: Focus indicator visibility
- Visual test: Active state during drag
- E2E test: State transitions
- Accessibility test: Reduced motion preference

### AC8: Touch-Friendly on Mobile (Larger Hit Areas)

**Given** the user interacts on a touch device
**When** the slider is used on mobile viewport
**Then**:
- Handle touch target is ≥44px × 44px
- +/- buttons are ≥44px × 44px
- Track is taller (10px) for easier tapping
- Touch drag is responsive and smooth
- Value badge appears during touch drag
- Haptic feedback on value change (if supported)

**Validation**:
- E2E test: Touch interaction on mobile viewport (360px)
- E2E test: Touch target sizes meet minimum
- Visual test: Mobile-specific styling
- Performance test: Touch drag frame rate

---

### AC9: Satisfying Interaction Feedback

**Given** the user adjusts a slider
**When** the interaction completes
**Then**:
- Handle has smooth scale animations
- Value badge has fade in/out transitions
- Success state: brief green glow after adjustment
- All animations run at 60fps (no jank)
- Animations are disabled if prefers-reduced-motion
- Audio/haptic feedback on supported devices

**Validation**:
- Visual test: Animation smoothness
- Performance test: Frame rate during interaction
- E2E test: Success state animation
- Accessibility test: Reduced motion compliance
