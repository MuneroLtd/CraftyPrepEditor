  - **Medium**: Noticeable issues, fix when possible
  - **Low**: Minor polish, nice-to-have
- [ ] UX ratings (1-10 scale) for 5 categories:
  - Layout (organization, visual hierarchy)

---

## Next Steps

After this planning task is complete:

1. **Update task status**: Change task-023 from PENDING to PLANNED in `.autoflow/TASK.yml`
2. **Review with stakeholders**: Ensure design direction is approved
3. **Proceed to task-024**: Begin implementing Modern Image Editor Layout
4. **Iterate as needed**: Refine design system based on implementation learnings

---

**Note**: This is a planning task only. No code implementation is required for task-023. All acceptance criteria focus on documentation, specifications, and design artifacts that will guide the implementation in subsequent tasks (task-024 through task-032).
