## Code Quality Requirements

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- [ ] **DRY-1**: Aspect ratio calculation extracted to reusable utility
- [ ] **DRY-2**: Debounce logic extracted to reusable utility (if not exists)
- [ ] **DRY-3**: Canvas cleanup logic consistent across components
- [ ] **DRY-4**: Zoom controls reusable (not duplicated for both canvases)

### SOLID Principles

- [ ] **SOLID-1**: Single Responsibility - ImageCanvas only renders canvas, no zoom/pan logic
- [ ] **SOLID-2**: Single Responsibility - ImagePreview manages state, not rendering details
- [ ] **SOLID-3**: Single Responsibility - ZoomControls only handles UI, not zoom calculation
- [ ] **SOLID-4**: Open/Closed - Components accept props for extension (zoom, pan, dimensions)
- [ ] **SOLID-5**: Dependency Inversion - Components depend on abstractions (props), not concrete implementations

### FANG Best Practices

- [ ] **FANG-1**: Components properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] **FANG-2**: useCallback used for event handlers (prevents re-renders)
- [ ] **FANG-3**: useMemo used for expensive calculations (aspect ratio, bounds)
- [ ] **FANG-4**: useEffect dependencies correctly specified
- [ ] **FANG-5**: No unnecessary re-renders (verified with React DevTools Profiler)

### Security (OWASP)

- [ ] **SEC-1**: No XSS vulnerabilities (canvas API doesn't execute scripts)
- [ ] **SEC-2**: No injection attacks possible (canvas only renders images)
- [ ] **SEC-3**: Input validation - image prop type-checked (HTMLImageElement | null)

### Performance Best Practices

- [ ] **PERF-6**: Debounce applied to window resize listener
- [ ] **PERF-7**: requestAnimationFrame used for pan dragging
- [ ] **PERF-8**: Canvas context saved/restored properly (no transform accumulation)
- [ ] **PERF-9**: Event listeners passive where applicable
- [ ] **PERF-10**: useCallback prevents function recreation on every render

## Acceptance Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path - Image Preview
**Given** I am on the CraftyPrep app
**When** I upload a valid image file (JPEG, PNG)
**Then** The image appears in the "Original" canvas
**And** The image maintains its aspect ratio
**And** The image is centered on the canvas
**And** The "Processed" canvas is empty (awaiting auto-prep)

### Scenario 2: Responsive Layout - Desktop
**Given** The app is viewed on a desktop browser (≥1024px width)
**When** I upload an image
**Then** The "Original" and "Processed" canvases display side-by-side
**And** Each canvas takes approximately 50% of the available width

### Scenario 3: Responsive Layout - Mobile
**Given** The app is viewed on a mobile browser (<768px width)
**When** I upload an image
**Then** The "Original" canvas displays above the "Processed" canvas
**And** Each canvas takes the full width of the screen
**And** The layout transitions smoothly from desktop to mobile

### Scenario 4: Zoom In
**Given** An image is displayed in the canvas
**When** I click the "Zoom In" button
**Then** The zoom level increases by 25% (e.g., 100% → 125%)
**And** The zoom percentage updates (e.g., "125%")
**And** The image scales up proportionally
**And** The zoom in button is disabled when reaching 400% (4x)

### Scenario 5: Zoom Out
**Given** An image is zoomed in (e.g., 200%)
**When** I click the "Zoom Out" button
**Then** The zoom level decreases by 25% (e.g., 200% → 175%)
**And** The zoom percentage updates (e.g., "175%")
**And** The image scales down proportionally
**And** The zoom out button is disabled when reaching 100% (1x)

### Scenario 6: Zoom with Slider
**Given** An image is displayed in the canvas
**When** I drag the zoom slider to 250%
**Then** The zoom level updates to 2.5x
**And** The zoom percentage displays "250%"
**And** The image scales to 250% size

### Scenario 7: Pan/Drag (Zoomed In)
**Given** An image is zoomed in to 200%
**When** I click and drag on the canvas
**Then** The image pans in the direction of the drag
**And** The cursor changes to "grabbing" during the drag
**And** The pan is constrained to the image bounds (cannot drag beyond edges)

### Scenario 8: Pan/Drag (Not Zoomed)
**Given** An image is at 100% zoom (1x)
**When** I click and drag on the canvas
**Then** Nothing happens (pan is disabled at 1x zoom)
**And** The cursor remains as default (not "grab")

### Scenario 9: Reset Zoom and Pan
**Given** An image is zoomed to 300% and panned to offset (50, 50)
**When** I click the "Reset" button
**Then** The zoom returns to 100% (1x)
**And** The pan offset returns to (0, 0)
**And** The image is centered on the canvas again

### Scenario 10: Window Resize
**Given** An image is displayed in the canvas
**When** I resize the browser window
**Then** The canvas dimensions update to fit the new container size
**And** The image aspect ratio is maintained
**And** The resize is debounced (does not trigger on every pixel change)

### Scenario 11: Multiple Image Loads
**Given** I have uploaded an image
**When** I upload a different image
**Then** The old image is cleared from the canvas
**And** The new image appears in the "Original" canvas
**And** There are no memory leaks (canvas context cleaned up properly)
**And** The zoom and pan reset to defaults (100%, offset 0,0)

### Scenario 12: Keyboard Navigation
**Given** I am using keyboard navigation (Tab key)
**When** I tab through the page
**Then** The zoom in button receives focus (visible focus indicator)
**And** The zoom slider receives focus (visible focus indicator)
**And** The zoom out button receives focus (visible focus indicator)
**And** The reset button receives focus (visible focus indicator)
**And** All controls are activatable with Enter/Space keys
