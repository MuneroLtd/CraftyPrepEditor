## Validation Steps

1. **Visual Testing**:
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Test at viewport sizes: 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 1920px
   - Verify layout adapts correctly
   - Check color contrast with browser DevTools

2. **Keyboard Testing**:
   - Navigate with Tab key only
   - Verify all interactive elements accessible
   - Check focus indicators visible
   - Test skip link functionality

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Run `npm run test` - all tests pass
   - Run `npm run test:coverage` - coverage ≥80%
   - Run `npm run typecheck` - no errors
   - Run `npm run lint` - no errors

4. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Run Lighthouse audit (target: ≥95/100)
   - Run axe-core DevTools (0 violations)
   - Test with keyboard navigation
   - Verify semantic HTML with DevTools

## Notes

- This task focuses on **structure and layout**, not full application features
- Routing mentioned in title may be addressed in future task if needed
- Layout should be flexible enough to accommodate future features
- All components should be tested and documented
