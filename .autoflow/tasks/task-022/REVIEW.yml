    title: DRY Violation - Hardcoded VALID_PRESETS Array
    severity: HIGH
    category: Code Quality
    location: src/lib/utils/settingsStorage.ts:27-35
    description: |
      VALID_PRESETS array is hardcoded with preset names instead of being derived
      from the MaterialPresetName type. This violates DRY principle and creates
      a maintenance burden - if someone adds a new preset type, they must remember
      to update both the type definition and this array.
    expected: |
      The validation should derive valid presets from the MaterialPresetName type
      itself, ensuring single source of truth.
    fix_required:
      - Create a constant array of valid presets derived from the type system
      - Update isValidPersistedSettings to use type-safe validation
      - Ensure no hardcoded preset lists exist

      - src/lib/types/presets.ts:13-20

      Fixed by exporting VALID_PRESET_NAMES from presetConfigurations.ts, derived from
      MATERIAL_PRESETS.presets using Object.keys(). Updated settingsStorage.ts to import
      and use this constant instead of hardcoded array. Single source of truth maintained.

    title: Missing Component Tests for ClearSettingsButton
    severity: MEDIUM
    category: Testing
    location: src/components/ClearSettingsButton.tsx
    description: |
      The ClearSettingsButton component has no unit tests. Component tests are
      essential for verifying behavior, accessibility, and preventing regressions.
    expected: |
      Unit tests covering:
      - Renders correctly with all props
      - Calls onClear when clicked
      - Respects disabled state
      - Has correct accessibility attributes (aria-label, title)
      - Icon renders correctly
    fix_required:
      - Create src/tests/unit/components/ClearSettingsButton.test.tsx
      - Test all props and interactions
      - Test accessibility attributes
      - Achieve ≥80% coverage
    references:
      - src/components/ClearSettingsButton.tsx
    resolved: true
    resolution: |
      Created comprehensive test file with 13 tests covering all requirements:
      rendering, props, interactions, keyboard navigation, accessibility attributes,
      disabled state, and styling. All tests pass (13/13).

    title: Missing Component Tests for PrivacyDisclosure
    severity: MEDIUM
    category: Testing
    location: src/components/PrivacyDisclosure.tsx
    description: |
      The PrivacyDisclosure component has no unit tests. While it's a simple
      component, tests ensure it renders correctly and maintains accessibility.
    expected: |
      Unit tests covering:
      - Renders privacy message correctly
      - Has correct text content
      - Text is accessible and readable
      - Component mounts without errors
    fix_required:
      - Create src/tests/unit/components/PrivacyDisclosure.test.tsx
      - Test rendering and content
      - Test accessibility
      - Achieve ≥80% coverage
    references:
      - src/components/PrivacyDisclosure.tsx
    resolved: true
    resolution: |
      Created comprehensive test file with 11 tests covering all requirements:
      rendering, content verification, accessibility (including new role="note"),
      styling, and mount/unmount behavior. All tests pass (11/11).

    title: Unnecessary useEffect Executions in App.tsx
    severity: LOW
    category: Performance
    location: src/App.tsx:88-95
    description: |
      The useEffect that applies initial settings runs on every initialSettings
      change, but only applies when !uploadedImage. This creates unnecessary
      effect executions after the initial application.

      Current logic:
      - Effect depends on [initialSettings, uploadedImage]
      - But only acts when initialSettings exists AND !uploadedImage
      - After first execution, subsequent runs are no-ops
    expected: |
      Use a ref to track if initial settings have been applied, preventing
      unnecessary re-executions of the effect.
    fix_required:
      - Add a useRef to track if initial settings were applied
      - Skip effect execution if already applied
      - Maintain existing behavior but improve efficiency
    references:
      - src/App.tsx:88-95
    resolved: true
    resolution: |
      Added initialSettingsAppliedRef (useRef) to track application status.
      Updated useEffect to check ref before applying settings and set ref to true
      after application. Effect now runs only once when needed, maintaining behavior
      while improving efficiency.

    title: PrivacyDisclosure Could Benefit from ARIA Role
    severity: LOW
    category: Accessibility
    location: src/components/PrivacyDisclosure.tsx:8-12
    description: |
      The privacy disclosure text would benefit from an explicit ARIA role or
      semantic element to improve screen reader experience. While the current
      implementation is functional, using role="note" or role="status" would
      provide better semantic meaning.
    expected: |
      Add appropriate ARIA role to enhance accessibility for screen readers.
    fix_required:
      - Add role="note" to the paragraph element
      - Verify with screen reader testing
      - Document the role in code comments
    references:
      - src/components/PrivacyDisclosure.tsx:8-12
    resolved: true
    resolution: |
      Added role="note" to paragraph element for enhanced screen reader accessibility.
      Updated component documentation to mention ARIA role. Added corresponding tests
      to verify role attribute is present and functional.
